                  One of the most common mistakes made by a salesperson is to rely heavily on their assumptions
                  regarding the needs/wants of their prospect/buyer. As a result, they directly start pitching to buyers
                  without even analyzing the context of their problem. Whenever a person asked you to sell a pen, what’s
                  your first response? Start exaggerating about a pen you find worthy? Or Did you take a pause & ask
                  them regarding why, when, & what kind of pen do they prefer?
                  <br><br>
                  Probing your prospect in advance helps you to pinpoint all the wants & needs of a buyer. While the
                  basic needs are timeless & universal, but talking to buyers reveals their wants. You’ll often find
                  that people’s declared preferences are far different from their revealed preferences. How can somebody
                  know what they want if they haven’t experienced it yet? Thus, by probing, a salesperson can understand
                  the prospect’s exact psychology & situations in detail. And match them with the correct solutions &
                  offer great deals.

                  Has your name ever been on a salesperson's call list? Did you receive a lot of telecalls every day? In
                  the modern capitalized world, a buyer gets almost 10-15 telemarketing calls per day. I can’t imagine
                  how hard it is to listen to these monotonous voice calls. It is enough to piss off the buyer if you’re
                  the 16th one! When everyone is trying to sell, then how does one sound different? How to capture
                  buyer’s interest?
                  <br><br>
                  The answer is to apply a Buyer Context-oriented approach when you make the first move. The idea is to
                  add some value to your prospect’s life & not just directly pitch them your product/service. Your
                  marketing team has acquired the prospects/leads by using quality educational content that is highly
                  relevant to the buyer’s context. Try to go through the prospect’s activities & think about the
                  problems the buyer is looking to solve. Then call them up & state how you’re able to solve their
                  problems. The buyer now perceives your company as smart, helpful, and relevant. Compare this approach
                  to the traditional stream of elevator pitches. With which kind of salesperson would you rather engage?

                <p>Buying journey starts with a buyer discovering a problem that he would like to solve. From there, the

                <p>That's one of the best pieces of advice I learned from my Sales Trainer during my initial days. A
                  buyer is not just a customer but also a retail investor to the company. Similarly, a prospect is a
                  future investor to a salesperson. Even if you didn't have the right product for them, it's crucial to
                  avoid confrontation and offer alternatives instead of just saying No. The approach should always be
                  towards helping out the prospects in making better choices to build deep bonds with them. The more
                  they trust a salesperson, the more they are likely to buy from them in the future. The prospects can
                  even give high potential referrals.

                <p>If Apple had been like any other computer company, a marketing/sales message from them might sound
                  like this - "We make great computers, they're beautifully design and user friendly. Wanna buy one?"
                  But how Apple actually communicates - "Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo, we
                  believe in thinking differently. The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products
                  beautifully designed, simple to use, and user-friendly. We just happen to make great computers. Wanna

                  <br><br>
                  Most of the salespeople only explain what they do & how they do it. But one should always start with
                  Why, then How, and then finally What. Make people believe what you believe before you directly pitch
                  them your product. This process will help a salesperson in winning the gut & trust of a prospect.

                <p>Every salesperson has the opportunity to be perceived as a thought leader by his potential buyers.
                  Social media presents an opportunity for all salespeople to be perceived as trusted advisors by their
                  buyers. Salespeople should take some time normally spent prospecting and reallocate it to social media
                  participation. The rewards are greater. For example, write a blog article about a question your buyers
                  frequently ask you or share posts & status from other thought leaders.

                  Modern Selling feels less like a seller/buyer relationship and more like a doctor/patient

                  get a discount?” You take the pills.

                <p>Hubspot(an American developer and marketer of software products for inbound marketing, sales, and
                  customer service) came out with a formal regression analysis correlating the hiring characteristics
                  with post-hire sales success. The results from the first model suggested that the traits traditionally
                  associated with salespeople, such as aggression, high pressure, and strong objection handling ability
                  had the worst correlation with success. Why?
                  <br><br>
                  The internet's rise in prominence has caused a shift in power from the salesperson to the buyer. With
                  this shift in power, buyers will no longer tolerate being strong-armed into a purchase. They will
                  respond to salespeople who are intelligent, helpful, and respectful of their needs. Five traits
                  correlated most significantly with sales success: Coachability, Curiosity, Prior Success,
                  Intelligence, Work Ethic.

                <p>Society can't flourish if it looks down upon its wealth creators. The Salespeople are the ones who
                  bring fuel to run the Engine(Startup/Company). We call that fuel - Revenue. They are the soldiers of
                  an organization who work days & nights, always on their feet, entire weight on their shoulders, at

                  My little advice to all young Entrepreneurs & Managers would be to not give up on them effortlessly.
                  It's amazing when one of your new Sales hires comes out of training crushing the phones, exceeding
                  quota after quota, and maintaining a great attitude. Unfortunately, not all hires work out that way.
                  The weak salespeople need some effective coaching & hand-holding. Pick a deficiency in a salesperson's
                  process, coach them on it, and check in with them the next day. If an improvement is visible and it
                  appears to stick, that's a promising sign. However, if the salesperson doesn't apply the coaching,
                  then that is a bad sign!

                <p>Buyers should not be asked to understand the salesperson's solution and how it can help with their
                  own goals. Instead, the salesperson should understand the buyers' goals and how his own solution can
                  help achieve those goals. A smart salesperson needs to transform their product’s generic messaging
                  into a customized pitch that resonates with the buyer, addresses the buyer's needs, frequently asked
                  counters, and uses the buyer's terminology. Don’t describe features. Describe the solved path. Break
                  down the Offer Price into cost per day/month/year & how they save money. Anticipate the buyer's fears
                  and prepare logical answers to overcome their fears. The best-trained salespeople have experienced the
                  day-to-day job of their potential customers. The modern form of selling requires the salesperson to
                  truly understand their customer what it's like to be in their shoes.

                <p>The exercise of calling, emailing, and meeting with a potential customer is often referred to as
                  Prospecting. The purpose is to build a strong relationship with them by giving them value - True
                  Value. Education is one of the best ways to do this. If someone is thinking of buying or wants to
                  learn, they will have more trust in their educator, and they will be thankful for being concise and
                  saving them time. It allows them to warm up to the idea of buying. The usual method most fail with is
                  "like asking someone to marry you on a first date!"

                  In short, give your prospects a <strong> High-Value Content Offer</strong>. It could be long-form
                  copywriting(as long as it is engaging & entertaining) with some clickbait titles(statistics shows that
                  it works). Other forms of HVCO are Free Consultations, Videos, Courses, Toolkits, Infographic,
                  Assessments. The HVCO's should have - Great Tittle; Bullet points of the value offering; Visual
                  representation of what is on offer; Contact Details.

                <p> <strong>Discussion:</strong> Stop talking about your product, company from the beginning. Highlight
                  the problems & talk in detail about how they have tried to fix the problems before. Customers only
                  care about themselves. Only after listening and understanding, talk about how you can help. Get their
                  trust, show that you are an expert. Consult with them, give them some tips, or make a plan.
                </p>

                <p> <strong>Product Mapping:</strong> Mention the features, advantages & benefits of your product.
                  Create a table of all your features. Then write the benefits of all of those features. It should be
                  like connecting the dots. From this, you can create your outstanding offer.
                </p>

                <p> <strong>Offer:</strong> Give one great Offer you're sure about. Never give too many alternatives to
                  a buyer. It leads to confusion. Have your lowest price offer, and if you are asking for a lot, split
                  it into multiple payments as money is crucial for everyone today. Demonstrate the product,
                  specifically to their problem and how it is different from the competitors. State the guarantees,
                  expiring offers, time limits, and availability.
